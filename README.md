## About this app
I created this app to practice basic of React js.
This is a movie application. At the moment this site only shows some of movies but I will add searching function so it allows users look for what they want to watch. Also it will allow users sign up or log in to track their searching history.

## Problem
This is very simple application so did not have much hard parts but at first I wanted to show the most popular movies which were downloaded most. However I was not allowed to access the website I wanted to use and the API did not work.

## Solutions
Therefore I used something else which does not offer download ranking.
Instead of download ranking I picked up the moivies which title include the word of 'with' and were released in 21st century.
